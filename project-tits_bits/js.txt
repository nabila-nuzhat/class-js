- Model, feature, services of a project:
- MVC(Model View Controller) pattern
    - divide Models of a project 1st
    - "models" controls "data"
    - create "model":
        - based on which "category of data" will be collected/received
        - model-name always singular
        - eg. user name's data, expense's data in splitter project
        - eg. when a model is called a new user will be created

    - "features" ~ services : 
    - "controllers": 
        - used in backend
        - controls request, response

    - services ~ features:
        - can be used as controller, but controllers only controls equest, response
        - service calls ....

    - View: UI of the project
