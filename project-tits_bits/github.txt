        4️⃣ Easy to break, hard to debug 🐛

        When you copy node_modules:

        files may be missing

        permissions may be wrong

        symlinks may break

        Debugging this is painful compared to a clean install.

        5️⃣ Security & trust 🔐

        Sharing node_modules means:

        you’re shipping thousands of files

        you don’t really know what’s inside

        harder to audit or scan for vulnerabilities

        Clean install = safer.
