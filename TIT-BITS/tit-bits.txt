    - "Objects" that are created from a "class" are called "instances".
    - core concept of OOP: is to "separate" "concerns into entities" "which are coded as objects".
    - Each entity will group a given set of information (properties) and actions (methods) that can be performed by the entity
    - OOP makes heavy usage of "classes" (which are a way of creating new objects starting out from a blueprint or boilerplate that the programmer sets).
