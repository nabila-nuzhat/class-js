CDN (Content Delivery Network)
One-line definition:

CDN = many servers around the world that deliver website files faster to users
What a CDN actually is

CDN files (JS, CSS, images, videos) are stored on online servers

Your browser downloads those files over the internet

No internet ❌ → no CDN ❌

So yes:

CDN ≠ offline storage

Important clarification (this is where beginners get confused):
❌ CDN is NOT “installed” on your computer

You don’t install a CDN like software

You just link files from a CDN in HTML/JS

Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine you want a specific book from a library. Without a CDN, you have to drive to the main library in a distant city (the origin server). With a CDN, there are local, small branch libraries (CDN servers) in your neighborhood that already have a copy of the popular book, so you get it immediately.
