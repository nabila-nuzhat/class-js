- opacity ==============
    - 2 types
    - parent element bg(div) => child element gets also
    - only child element => only color opacity

- synchronus vs asynchronous

- // EXPLAIN LATER with DRAG and DROP, File Reader
    - events bubbling, delegetion CLASS mengtioned

- prototype-chaining ========
- syntatic sugar ====
- auto semicolon in VS code: ===
    alt + shift + f

- Array.from() ===
- eg. Array.from(element.children)
    is a safe, clean way to turn “array-like” or iterable things into a real Array 
    — so you can use array methods like map, filter, reduce, etc.

    - The problem it solves:
        Some JS things look like arrays but aren’t arrays:

        1. NodeList → from querySelectorAll
        2. HTMLCollection → from .children
        3. arguments
        4. Strings
        5. Sets / Maps
    - Array.from() is a static method of the "Array constructor", 
      NOT a method on array instances.
    - If you call it on Array, it’s static.
      If you call it on [], it’s an instance method.
      Mental model 🧠

    - Think of it like this:
        - Static method → used to create arrays
        Array.from(), Array.isArray(), Array.of()

        - Instance method → used to operate on arrays
        map(), push(), forEach()

- template
    - "JS DOM template" generally refers to using JavaScript to generate and insert HTML structures into the Document Object Model (DOM). 
   - JavaScript DOM templating, primarily using the <template> HTML element, serves to create reusable, inert HTML fragments that can be cloned and inserted into the live Document Object Model (DOM) dynamically at runtime using JavaScript. 
   - browser initially, acting as a blueprint until activated by script.
   - written in HTML (yet not visible without comment, without using css)
   = <template></template
   - Q: html tag written in html but will not be visible
    A: kept inside template tag

   - creates "document fragments"
   - reused by cloning 
   - content painting: to avoid, template is used in DOM
        - when update occurs in js, js startsover from 1st, rather than,
        - updatimg/patching the selected part.
        - to avoid it template is used
        - reload time lessens
        - dom loads initial 1 time, Loop runs multiple times

- dom range
-  window.getSelection();
