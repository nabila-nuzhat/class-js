- opacity ==============
    - 2 types
    - parent element bg(div) => child element gets also
    - only child element => only color opacity

- synchronus vs asynchronous

    - events bubbling, delegetion CLASS mengtioned

- prototype-chaining ========
- syntatic sugar ====
- auto semicolon in VS code: ===
    alt + shift + f

- Array.from() ===
- eg. Array.from(element.children)
    is a safe, clean way to turn “array-like” or iterable things into a real Array 
    — so you can use array methods like map, filter, reduce, etc.

    - The problem it solves:
        Some JS things look like arrays but aren’t arrays:

        1. NodeList → from querySelectorAll
        2. HTMLCollection → from .children
        3. arguments
        4. Strings
        5. Sets / Maps
    - Array.from() is a static method of the "Array constructor", 
      NOT a method on array instances.
    - If you call it on Array, it’s static.
      If you call it on [], it’s an instance method.
      Mental model 🧠

    - Think of it like this:
        - Static method → used to create arrays
        Array.from(), Array.isArray(), Array.of()

        - Instance method → used to operate on arrays
        map(), push(), forEach()
